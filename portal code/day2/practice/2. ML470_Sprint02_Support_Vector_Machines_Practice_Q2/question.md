Problem Statement

Employee retention is a critical concern for any organization striving to maintain a skilled and experienced workforce. High turnover can result in increased recruitment costs and loss of expertise.

Before building predictive models, it is important to explore the dataset for extreme values that may influence analysis.

In this task, you are required to visualize and assess outliers in the dataset.

Objectives

1. Detect outliers in the dataset

Identify extreme values that deviate significantly from the majority of the data.
Focus on numerical columns.

2. Visualize the outliers

Generate boxplots to display the spread and highlight potential outliers.

Sample Visualization

Boxplots for Outlier Detection:



This visualization will produce boxplots showing the distribution of numerical features and highlighting any outlier points present in the dataset.
