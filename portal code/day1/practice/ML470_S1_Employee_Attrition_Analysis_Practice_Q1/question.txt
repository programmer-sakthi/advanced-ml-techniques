Problem Statement



A leading company is experiencing high employee attrition and wants to identify key factors influencing employee retention. The HR analytics team needs to explore and analyze the employee dataset to understand patterns related to satisfaction levels, performance evaluations, workload, compensation, and other factors that may impact whether employees leave the organization.



As the first step in this analytical process, the team needs to:



Load and inspect the employee dataset – Import the CSV file containing employee records and display the first 5 rows to understand the data structure.
Determine dataset size – Identify the total number of employee records (samples) in the dataset to understand the scope of analysis.
Examine data types – Display the data type of each column to ensure proper handling of numeric and categorical variables in subsequent analysis.
Identify feature columns – List the specific feature columns that will be used for predictive modeling and classification tasks. These features include satisfaction_level, last_evaluation, number_project, average_montly_hours, time_spend_company, Work_accident, and promotion_last_5years.
Generate statistical summary – Compute and display descriptive statistics (count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles) for all numeric columns to understand data distribution and identify potential outliers.
Preview categorical data – Display sample records from the categorical columns (Department, salary, left) to understand the categorical distribution and verify data integrity.


This exploratory data analysis forms the foundation for deeper insights into employee retention patterns and will guide the development of predictive models.

Input format :
CSV File Input:

The program prompts the user to enter the name of the CSV file containing employee data.
Input must include the file extension .csv.
Output format :
The program generates the following outputs in sequence:



1. First 5 rows of the dataset:



Displays a DataFrame showing the first 5 employee records.
Output includes all columns with proper formatting.
Ends with [5 rows x 10 columns] indicating dimensions.


2. Number of samples in the data:



Prints the total count of employee records (rows) in the dataset.
Single integer value on its own line.


3. Data types of each column:



Displays each column name followed by its data type.
Format: column_name dtype
Ends with dtype: object on its own line.


4. Feature columns used for classification:



Prints a Python list containing the names of feature columns.
List format: ['satisfaction_level', 'last_evaluation', 'number_project', 'average_montly_hours', 'time_spend_company', 'Work_accident', 'promotion_last_5years']


5. Statistical summary of numeric columns:



Displays descriptive statistics using pandas .describe() output format.
Includes: count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75%, max for each numeric column.
Shows [8 rows x 8 columns] indicating the summary dimensions.


6. Sample categorical data:



Displays the first 5 rows of Department, salary, and left columns.
If these columns are not present, prints: "Categorical columns ('Department', 'salary', 'left') not found in dataset."


Refer to the sample output for exact formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
CSV File Constraints



File must be a valid comma-separated CSV file with .csv extension.
File must exist in the same directory as the Python script.
File must contain a header row with exact column names (case-sensitive).
All 10 columns must be present with exact names: satisfaction_level, last_evaluation, number_project, average_montly_hours, time_spend_company, Work_accident, left, promotion_last_5years, Department, salary


Column Data Constraints



satisfaction_level: Float values between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive).
last_evaluation: Float values between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive).
number_project: Non-negative integers representing project count.
average_montly_hours: Positive integers representing monthly work hours.
time_spend_company: Non-negative integers representing years at company.
Work_accident: Binary values (0 = No accident, 1 = Had accident).
left: Binary values (0 = Stayed, 1 = Left the company).
promotion_last_5years: Binary values (0 = Not promoted, 1 = Promoted).
Department: Non-empty string values (e.g., sales, technical, support, IT, admin, management, marketing, accounting, hr, RandD, product_mng).
salary: Must be one of three categorical values: low, medium, or high.


Program Constraints



The program uses pandas for data loading and manipulation.
If the CSV file is not found, the program prints an error message: "Error: File '{filename}' not found." and exits.
The .head() method displays exactly the first 5 rows of the dataset.
The shape attribute .shape[0] retrieves the total number of rows (samples).
The .dtypes attribute displays data types for all columns in the format: column name followed by dtype.
The feature columns list is hardcoded and must match exactly: ['satisfaction_level', 'last_evaluation', 'number_project', 'average_montly_hours', 'time_spend_company', 'Work_accident', 'promotion_last_5years']
The .describe() method generates statistical summaries only for numeric columns (excludes Department and salary).
For categorical data preview, the program checks if all three columns (Department, salary, left) exist before displaying them.
All print statements must match the exact format shown in the sample output, including spacing and line breaks.
