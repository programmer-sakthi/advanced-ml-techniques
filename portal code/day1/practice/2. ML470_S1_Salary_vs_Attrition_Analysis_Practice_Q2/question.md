Problem Statement

Employee retention is a critical challenge for any growing organization. High turnover not only increases recruitment and training costs but also results in the loss of valuable skills and expertise. To support strategic HR decision-making, the company aims to identify the factors influencing employee attrition, with a specific focus on compensation.

In this task, you are required to analyze the relationship between employee salary levels and retention outcomes. By visualizing how salary categories relate to whether employees leave or stay, the organization can better understand the role compensation plays in workforce stability.

Objectives

Examine the distribution of employee retention across salary categories

Create a visual representation that compares the number of employees who left versus those who stayed, segmented by salary levels (e.g., low, medium, high).

Identify whether salary has a measurable impact on attrition

Analyze the visualization to determine if higher or lower salary groups show distinct retention patterns.

This analysis will assist HR teams in designing effective compensation strategies, adjusting salary structures if necessary, and implementing retention programs for at-risk employee segments.
