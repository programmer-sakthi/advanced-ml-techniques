Problem Statement



A healthcare analytics company is developing a predictive system to identify patients at risk of developing diabetes. Early detection of diabetes risk can enable healthcare providers to implement preventive measures, recommend lifestyle changes, and initiate timely medical interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.



The company has collected a comprehensive dataset containing various health metrics, lifestyle factors, and medical history information from patients. This dataset includes features such as blood sugar levels, BMI, HbA1c levels, age, family history, physical activity, dietary habits, blood pressure readings, cholesterol levels, and other relevant health indicators. Each patient record is labeled as either diabetic or non-diabetic.



To build a robust and reliable diabetes classification system, the data science team needs to implement an AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) classifier. AdaBoost is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier, making it particularly effective for binary classification problems in healthcare applications.



Your task is to:



Implement evaluation functions – Create a function to evaluate multi-label classifier performance using confusion matrix and classification report metrics.


Build and train an AdaBoost classifier – Develop a function that trains an AdaBoost model using Repeated K-Fold Cross-Validation to ensure robust performance estimates and prevent overfitting.


Evaluate model performance – Use cross-validation to compute accuracy, recall, F1-score, and precision metrics, providing comprehensive insights into the model's predictive capabilities.


The implementation will be done in a custom module (ML_Modules.py) that contains reusable functions for model training and evaluation. The main program will load the patient data, prepare the features and target variables, and invoke the AdaBoost classifier to generate predictions and performance metrics.
