Problem Statement



A real estate analytics firm wants to predict continuous house prices using property features rather than categorizing properties into price ranges. The dataset includes key attributes such as bedrooms, floors, construction grade, above-ground square footage, and neighborhood characteristics. Accurate price prediction helps buyers, sellers, agents, and investors make informed decisions.



Your tasks are:



1. Load and prepare housing data



Import the CSV dataset
Separate features (bedrooms, floors, grade, sqft_above, sqft_living15, sqft_lot15) and the target variable (price)


2. Implement AdaBoost Regression



Use DecisionTreeRegressor as base learners
Train using Repeated K-Fold Cross-Validation (10 folds × 3 repeats)
Compute and display R-squared performance


3. Implement Stacking Regression



Combine base models: Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree
Use Linear Regression as the meta-learner
Train using the same cross-validation strategy
Compute and display R-squared performance


4. Compare performance



Display R-squared scores of both models
Determine which ensemble predicts house prices more accurately


All model-building functions will reside in a custom module (ML_Modules.py), and the main program will orchestrate data loading, model training, and evaluation.

Input format :
CSV File Input:

The program prompts the user to enter the name of the CSV file containing housing data.
Input must include the file extension .csv.
Output format :
The program generates the following outputs in sequence:



1. AdaBoost Regressor Performance:



Prints the heading: === AdaBoost Regressor Performance ===
Prints: R-squared: X.XXX where X.XXX is the R² score computed across all 30 cross-validation folds (3 decimal places)
R-squared interpretation:
1.0 = Perfect predictions (model explains 100% of variance)
0.0 to 1.0 = Positive predictive power (higher is better)
0.0 = Model performs no better than predicting the mean price
Negative = Model performs worse than baseline (rare but possible)


2. Blank Line:



A single blank line separates the two model performance sections


3. Stacking Regressor Performance:



Prints the heading: === Stacking Regressor Performance ===
Prints: R-squared: X.XXX where X.XXX is the R² score computed across all 30 cross-validation folds (3 decimal places)


Refer to the sample output for exact formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
CSV File Constraints



Must exist in the same directory as the Python script
Must contain 7 columns: price, bedrooms, floors, grade, sqft_above, sqft_living15, sqft_lot15
'price' is the continuous target variable; all others are numeric features
Column order must have price first


Regression Models



AdaBoost Regressor:
Base learner: DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=42)
n_estimators=50, learning_rate=1.0, random_state=42


Stacking Regressor:
Base learners: Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Tree (random_state=42)
Meta-learner: Linear Regression
Internal CV: 5-fold
Cross-validation: RepeatedKFold with 10 splits, 3 repeats, random_state=42
Evaluate both models using R-squared


Program Behavior



Print R-squared for AdaBoost first, then a blank line, then Stacking
Handle missing file or missing price column with appropriate error messages and exit
All inputs and outputs must follow the exact formats specified


Implementation



All feature and target arrays must be converted to numpy arrays before processing
Evaluation must concatenate predictions across folds for R-squared computation
No additional output beyond what’s specified
Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
