Problem Statement



A real estate analytics firm is developing an intelligent property classification system to help buyers, sellers, and agents make informed decisions in a competitive housing market. The firm needs to categorize residential properties into distinct price range segments based on various physical and quality attributes of the houses.



The company has collected historical housing data containing key property features such as number of bedrooms, living area size, number of floors, construction grade, above-ground square footage, and neighborhood characteristics. Each property has been labeled into one of four price range categories: Low-Range, Mid-Range, Upper-Mid-Range, and Premium.



To build this classification system, the data science team will implement an AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) classifier with Decision Trees as base estimators. 



Your task is to:



Load and explore housing data – Import the preprocessed housing dataset and examine its structure to understand the available features and target variable.


Prepare features and target – Separate the feature variables (property attributes) from the target variable (encoded price range category).


Build an AdaBoost classifier – Implement a multi-class classification model using AdaBoost with Decision Tree base estimators, configured with appropriate hyperparameters for optimal performance.


Train and evaluate the model – Split the data into training and test sets, train the AdaBoost classifier, generate predictions, and compute comprehensive evaluation metrics including confusion matrix, classification report, accuracy, recall, F1-score, and precision.


The implementation will be done in a custom module (ML_Modules.py) that contains the function for building, training, and evaluating the AdaBoost classifier. The main program will orchestrate the workflow by loading data, preparing inputs, and invoking the classification function.

Price Range Categories:



0 = Premium (highest price range)
1 = Low-Range (lowest price range)
2 = Mid-Range (moderate price range)
3 = Upper-Mid-Range (above moderate price range)

Input format :
CSV File Input:

The program prompts the user to enter the name of the CSV file containing housing data.
Input must include the file extension .csv.
Output format :
The program generates the following outputs in sequence:



1. First 5 Rows of Data:



Displays the first 5 rows of the DataFrame showing all feature columns and the target variable
Shows in tabular format with column names and row indices
Includes a summary line: [5 rows x 8 columns] indicating the dimensions of the preview
Followed by a blank line


2. Confusion Matrix:



Prints the heading: Confusion Matrix
Displays a 4×4 confusion matrix (for 4 price range classes: 0, 1, 2, 3) showing:
Each row represents the actual class
Each column represents the predicted class
Diagonal elements show correct predictions for each class
Off-diagonal elements show misclassifications
Format: 4×4 array with proper alignment
Followed by: ===================


3. Classification Report:



Prints a blank line followed by the heading: Classification Report:
Displays a detailed classification report table containing:
Per-class metrics (for classes 0, 1, 2, and 3):
precision: Proportion of positive predictions that are correct for each class
recall: Proportion of actual positives correctly identified for each class
f1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall for each class
support: Number of actual occurrences of each class in the test set


Overall metrics:
accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions across all classes
macro avg: Unweighted mean of per-class metrics
weighted avg: Weighted mean of per-class metrics (weighted by support)
