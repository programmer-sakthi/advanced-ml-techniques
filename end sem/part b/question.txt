Problem Statement


A data analyst is working with a dataset containing multiple numerical features and wants to reduce its dimensionality while preserving the maximum amount of information.

Dataset used is iris.csv

Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dataset to two principal components and analyze the variance captured.

 Objective
Standardize the dataset using standarad scaler
Apply PCA with 2 components
Display the explained variance ratio


Input format :
First line read the dataset from directory

Output format :
First line print the Explained variance ration

For reference please look to sample output

Code constraints :
Use StandardScaler

n_components = 2

No classification model required

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
sample1.csv
Output 1 :
Explained Variance Ratio: [0.73103203 0.22641997]
