Problem Statement



﻿A banking institution wants to improve its marketing strategy by predicting whether a customer is likely to subscribe to a term deposit.



The dataset contains customer demographic details, contact information, and past interaction history with the bank.

You are required to preprocess the dataset, train a Decision Tree Classifier, and evaluate its performance using appropriate classification metrics.

Load the customer dataset

Convert categorical features into numerical values

le = LabelEncoder()

for col in df.select_dtypes(include='object'):

    df[col] = le.fit_transform(df[col])

Split the dataset into training and testing sets

Train a Decision Tree Classifier with limited depth (Look into code constraints)

Evaluate the model using:

Accuracy
Confusion Matrix


Input format :
First line read the csv file from a directory



Output format :
first line print the accuracy score

Second line print the Confusion matrix

For reference kindly look to sample output.

Code constraints :
Algorithm: DecisionTreeClassifier

max_depth = 3 and random_state = 42

Train-Test split: 80% – 20% and random_state = 42

Use LabelEncoder for categorical features



Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
sample1.csv
Output 1 :
Accuracy: 0.94
Confusion Matrix:
 [[16  1]
 [ 0  0]]
